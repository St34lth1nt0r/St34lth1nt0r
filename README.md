- 👋 Hi, I’m @St34lth1nt0r.
- 👀 I’m interested in cats, video games, and melee weapons.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the advantages of attaching a Titan Shield to a double-bladed LU Bu-style polearm (one blade on each end of the polearm).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the design for a rocket-powered shopping cart that is protected against hypermaneuverable fighter aircraft.
- 📫 How to reach me: email, text.
